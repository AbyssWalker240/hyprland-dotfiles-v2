The wrong environment provides too many distractions to get in the right mindset, which will then lead to procrastination, making you wait until it's too late to do anything about it. For me, these problems resulted in me failing way too many classes, losing my financial aid, and ending up paying thousands of dollars for my education when I could have had it for so much less. Now it's going to be so much harder for me to recover because of these mistakes. It's disappointing that I had to learn the hard way, but sometimes it's what I need. \n\nDuring my middle school years, I’ve always had problems with getting my homework done on time. My dad had to stay vigilant with me to make sure I got my stuff done, often checking in with me throughout the day to track assignments and any missing or late work. Once I got into high school, I kept the same habits, but with increasingly less hand holding by my father and teachers. This brought to my attention a potentially big issue I had: my laziness and procrastination problem. To me, after school I really just wanted to relax and play a game or whatever it was that day, I could just do the homework later after dinner or something. But then dinner would roll around, I would return to my room, and sit there, doing nothing. My brain would grind to a halt when it became time to be productive, and it would end up with me giving up after thirty minutes. “I’ll do it tomorrow”, I would tell myself. Tomorrow came and went, and the same thing would happen, a never-ending cycle.  \n\nMy father would notice my missing assignments and sit me down to do them on occasion. He would tell me the importance of building good habits early, and how this really matters for college. I heard him with my ears, but deeper in my mind nothing happened. I would get frustrated with punishments sometimes, because I didn’t quite understand why they had to happen, no matter how clearly they were explained. My senior year of high school was especially bad, since I now had a job that gave me a more instant reward - money. I had basically no incentive to do well. I passed high school with a pretty good GPA of 3.4, but that is only because of the pandemic, making my entire freshmen year a “no count” and online classes being super easy for me. This procrastination and laziness unfortunately continued through college, putting me into a very difficult situation. \n\nIn my very first semester, I was enrolled in four classes: English, sociology, math, and public speaking. It started out fine, but over time my initial drive to do well fell off. This was further accelerated by an English instructor who missed class without any warning or notification about 30% of the time, while being unhelpfully political in class with most of his lecture being useless fluff. My sociology instructor started out super engaging and interesting, however her first big project of the class introduced reading that I could not possibly understand even with her going over it many times over. She then quit halfway through the semester with zero notice to the class, and the replacement for the rest of the semester had a drastically different format and focus. My math class went really well, however, with me receiving an A. This was due to the way the class was structured, where 80% of the class's grade came from tests, with a couple opportunities for extra credit. I was able to get a good amount of the homework done, but the stuff I didn’t complete barely made a dent in my grade. My public speaking class not only had my procrastination holding me back, but it is also a topic I have never been well at. I am not good whatsoever at speaking in front of people. At the end of the semester, I only completed my math class. \n\nThat was a sign to me of some of my problems, and on top of those for my second semester I was also dealing with a new relationship that I was still figuring out how to balance with everything else. Again, the classes weren’t particularly difficult, I just didn't have time set aside or the drive to do assignments. I barely passed two of those classes and failed my second attempt at English as well. This semester made it apparent one of the biggest things I need to be successful: time on campus to complete schoolwork. Taking my laptop to do homework at my girlfriend’s house doesn’t cut it. There are simply too many distractions that I cannot ignore. Doing homework at home on my computer tends to be fine, but I can have a game launched in only seven keystrokes and the entire internet ready to browse in even less, so if for whatever reason I get distracted, it's really easy to stay distracted. Staying on campus or utilizing time in class helps because it’s not my personal computer with games installed, there is nothing on campus that can distract me too crazily from my work, and the environment just encourages productivity. \n\nSo, for my third semester, I found out what my issue was and was ready to implement a solution. Unfortunately, though, my SAP (Satisfactory Academic Progress) rating dropped and made me ineligible for any financial aid. This happened only after I attended my first days of class, and with such little warning I got dropped due to nonpayment. Not having financial aid brought up a whole new problem. I now had to work enough hours to afford all my expenses plus tuition and other class expenses. I only make minimum wage, so it would be nearly forty hours a week to afford to attend six credits a semester. That takes away a lot of time and energy from doing schoolwork, which I was already pretty short on. \n\nThat brings me to the present day, my fourth and fifth semesters at Delta, where I’m fully prepared to crawl through the mud to get my classes completed. I am only taking six credits, which will ease the load of paying for them and managing time, but it's already proving challenging. My motivation is much better this semester thanks to my jobs giving me plenty of flexibility and hours when I need them, meaning I can work around school and give myself time for work. I must sacrifice a few things, such as my motorcycling hobby, and spending a little more time away from people close to me, but right now I can’t have any extra expenses or loads. \n\nI can focus on those things once I get my financial aid back. That will serve as my motivation. After over eight years of procrastinating through middle school and high school, attending college with the same habits and mindset has taught me a valuable lesson when it comes to getting over laziness and getting work done. It has taught me about prioritization, and I have learned how much time certain aspects of my life take up. Not being careful with balancing everything can easily shatter this small, but solid foundation that I have given myself. My main goal, the reason I am attending college, is stability, and the best thing right now for that is getting financial aid back, so I will finally start working for it. It is unfortunate I had to learn it the hard way, but it seems that is how I learn best sometimes.
